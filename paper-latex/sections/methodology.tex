In this section, we detail the methods and approaches used in our research. The methodology is structured as follows:

\subsection{Research Design}
We employed a quantitative research design to gather and analyze data systematically.

\subsection{Data Collection}
Data was collected through surveys distributed to a sample population. The survey included questions designed to assess various parameters relevant to our study.

\subsection{Data Analysis}
The collected data was analyzed using statistical methods, including descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, to draw meaningful conclusions.

\subsection{Limitations}
We acknowledge certain limitations in our methodology, including potential biases in survey responses and the representativeness of the sample. 

Future research may address these limitations by employing a more diverse sample and utilizing mixed methods for data collection.
